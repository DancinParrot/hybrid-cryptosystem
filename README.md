# hybrid-cryptosystem
A hybrid cryptosystem that consists of SHA-256, ChaCha20, and ECDS, which helps to secure the transmission of data on a cryptocurrencyâ€™ underlying blockchain network which may involve application data as in the case of dApps such as radicle.xyz on Ethereum and Cardano Wall on Cardano. This allows blockchain networks to benefit from both the convenience and security of an asymmetric cryptosystem, as well as the efficiency of a symmetric algorithm for encryption of large data, which is paramount for cryptocurrencies where transaction speed is of utmost importance.
